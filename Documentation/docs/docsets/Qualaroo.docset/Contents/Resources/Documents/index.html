<p>QualarooSDKiOS is framework for iOS. It&rsquo;s used to display and gather data from survey configured by <a href="https://app.qualaroo.com">Qualaroo dashboard</a>.</p>

<h2 id='installation' class='heading'>Installation:</h2>

<p>Preferred and supported installation method right now is using CocoaPods.</p>
<h3 id='cocoapods' class='heading'>CocoaPods</h3>

<p><a href="http://cocoapods.org/">CocoaPods</a> is a dependency manager for Swift and Objective-C, which automates and simplifies the process of using 3rd-party libraries like QualarooSDK in your projects. You can install it with the following command:</p>
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>$ gem install cocoapods
</code></pre>

<p>To integrate QualarooSDKiOS into your Xcode project using CocoaPods, specify it in your Podfile:</p>
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>source 'https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs.git'
platform :ios, '8.0'

target 'TargetName' do
pod 'QualarooSDKiOS'
end
</code></pre>

<p>Then, run the following command:</p>
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>$ pod install
</code></pre>
<h3 id='manually' class='heading'>Manually</h3>

<p>If you don&rsquo;t want to use any package managers, you can always add QualarooSDKiOS manually as an embedded framework.  </p>

<ol>
<li>Drag and drop the framework into your Xcode project. Check <q>Copy items if needed</q>. You will want to use <q>Frameworks</q> folder.</li>
<li>Now you have to add it to the “Embedded Binaries” by using the “+” button on the <q>General</q> tab of your target.</li>
<li>Framework is supporting all architectures (so you can use it with simulator for example) but if you want to release you need to add this script to build phases after <q>Embed Frameworks</q>
&ldquo;`
APP_PATH=<q>${TARGET_BUILD_DIR}/${WRAPPER_NAME}</q></li>

## Requirements
Framework can be used for both iPhones and iPads.  
It supports iOS 9.0 and above.

## Usage
### Import
For swift it's just `import QualarooSDKiOS`  
For Objective-C it's `#import &lt;QualarooSDKiOS/QualarooSDKiOS.h&gt;`
### One-line-setup
If you want SDK to work with your application after integrating SDK is to call
</code></pre>

<p>Qualaroo.shared().configure(withApiKey: <q>sampleApiKey</q>)</p>
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>Where can I find "sampleApiKey"?

Go to your Qualaroo dashboard and find the mobile application that you're using.
Press setup on the top right corner of this section.

![where to find setup](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8074854/28832928-25c4021c-76de-11e7-86f1-643ddedf0672.png)

Then you should be able to copy API Key, that was just displayed.

![what shows after pressing setup](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8074854/28833190-e403a926-76de-11e7-872d-2fcbee759a42.png)

Use that copied key in configuration call.

Finished. Your app is now integrated with Qualaroo SDK.

### What next?

First of all you have probably noticed that `configure(withApiKey:)` throws error. That's why we can call it:
</code></pre>

<p>do {
  try Qualaroo.shared.configure(withApiKey: <q>sampleApiKey</q>)
} catch {
  print(<q>Probably something went wrong</q>)
}</p>
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>**Possible errors:**  
invalidAPIKey  
invalidSiteId  
dataEncodingException

All of them says that something is wrong with API key that you've provided.
If you can't find any mistake, then you should [contact us](mailto:support@qualaroo.com) and report a bug and/or error with your credentials.

### Features

#### Autotracking vs survey showing on demand
There are two ways you can display a survey.
- Calling `showSurvey(with alias: String, on viewController: UIViewController)`
- Automatically when  UIViewController matching proper alias will show up.

First case: You call a function and if there is a survey with given alias (and it was fetched properly) new UIViewController will be presented on top of given one. 
Second case: You don't do anything and survey will automatically shows when on viewDidAppear method of controller that name or title match any of active surveys. Under the hood there is some class name extracting and matching, with some viewDidAppear swizzling.

You can disable second mechanism while initializing Qualaroo framework, by adding autotracking param for configure method.
</code></pre>

<p>configure(withApiKey: <q>sampleApiKey</q>, autotracking: false)</p>
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>
#### Languages
The Qualaroo SDK supports using languages for surveys.  
If survey have questions written only for one language, then this language will be used.  

But, if there are more variations of the survey then we need to choose which one we should show to current user.

To add more languages (or see those assigned to a specific survey), open the edit page of the survey from your Qualaroo dashboard. You should see this view on top of the screen.

![Where to check languages](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8074854/28914723-09d321cc-783d-11e7-80e7-0d48613e566b.png)  
You can expand languages list and check how many currently are supported.

So what happen when we have more then one language and we want to be sure that correct one will be displayed. There is function:
</code></pre>

<p>Qualaroo.setPreferredSurveysLanguage(<q>fr</q>)</p>
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>This function can throw an error if you try to send language code that is something different then valid ISO Language Code. For example, we support languages like "en", "fr", "hu", etc. But a language with a country code wont be supported. So "en-UK", "en-AU" or "fr-CA" won't be supported.

If a language that you have specified is not supported by the survey, we will try to use English. If English is not supported, then we will use first one from supported languages list.

#### Theme

We know that you like do things your own way. That's why we allow you fo fully customize colors used for displaying surveys.  
First you need to create ThemeConfigurator with pattern you want to use.
</code></pre>

<p>ThemeConfigurator(logo: UIImage(named: <q>myOwnLogo</q>),
                   backgroundColor: .white,
                   textColor: .black,
                   dimType: .light,
                   buttonDisabledColor: .gray,
                   buttonEnabledColor: .green,
                   buttonTextColor: .white,
                   borderColor: .black)</p>
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>
Or you can use one of default two we've already created by calling `ThemeConfigurator.withStyle(_:logo:)`
Note that logo is optional. If you dont provide one, we provide the Qualaroo logo.
Right now we have two defaults styles:
</code></pre>

<p>ThemeConfigurator.Style.light
ThemeConfigurator.Style.dark</p>
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>If you want to apply created theme, just call `Qualaroo.setTheme(justCreatedTheme)`  
You can change theme as often as you want to. Changing it while a survey is currently displayed won't affect the survey. The current one will use previous theme, but next one and every one after will use one you set (unless another change is made).

#### Targeting
Sometimes you might want to add a targeting conditions that are specific to your product and aplication users.   
For instance, you might decide to display a survey only to users who made a purchase in the past 30 days and only when the shopping cart contains exactly 2 items or client type is trial.

First, you need to name these properties and create valid rule using proper dashboard field.

A rule can be created like `(last_purchase_time&lt;30 and shopping_cart_count=2) or client_type="trial"`.  
Then, when the rule is created and accepted, we can go back to app and set user properties for current user:
</code></pre>

<p>Qualaroo.shared.setUserProperties([<q>last_purchase_time</q>: <q>\(user.lastPurchaseTime)</q>,
                                   <q>shopping_cart_count</q>: <q>\(user.cart.items.count)</q>,
                                   <q>client_type</q>: user.type])</p>
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>If a user fulfills a given rule - the survey will show. It won't show for any user that is not fulfilling rule or if you didn't provide at least one of needed properties.

It's checked everytime that you ask for the survey or when you open survey revated view (check autotracking), so you can change in the meantime, and next time the survey will show up if requested.
